        tags must be open or close

    self-closing tag
    <br> </br>

     a self-closing tag is a tag that doesn't
      require a separate closing tag. It's written in a single line, ending with a 
      forward slash (/) before the closing angle bracket

EX: 
The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag

 <!--IMAGE-->
<!--<img /> is self closing tag-->
<!-- src = address of source
 basic:
<img src="image's path" />

-->
<img src="./public/pic7.jp" alt="this is an image" loading="lazy" width="400" height="400" />
<!-- alt can be used as alternative
 
       loading
    lazy
 Loads resources on demand: Only loads resources when they are actually 
 needed or come into view   
 Improves performance

 Example:
An image at the bottom of a long webpage is only loaded when the user scrolls down to it.
 
     Eager Loading

Loads all resources upfront: Loads all resources immediately when the page is first requested.
Can lead to slower initial load times: Especially on slower connections or with many large resources.
May waste resources: Loads resources that the user may never interact with.

    Example:
Loading all images on a page at once, even if some are in end of page.

 <!--VIDEO-->
          <!--<video /> is self closing tag-->
          <video src="./public/video.mp4" controls poster="./public/pic13.jpeg" loop width="400" height="400" >hello</video>
          <!--
          controls= Adds playback controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) for the video.
          poster="": Displays the specified image (img.jpg) as a placeholder before the video starts playing.
          loop: Ensures the video plays continuously in a loop

 muted attribute 
 in the HTML <video> tag when present, mutes the audio output of the video by default.

Here's how it works:
Mutes the video: 
When the muted attribute is included in the <video> tag, the video will start playing without any sound.
