    <h2>Uses of Logic Flowchart</h2>
    <p>Flowchart is used for the following reasons:</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Flowchart is used to represent an algorithm in simplw graphical manner. </li>
        <li> Flowchart is used to show the steps of an algrithim in easy way. </li>
        <li> Flowchart is used to understand the flow of the program. </li>
        <li> Flowchart is used to improve the logic for solving a problem. </li>
        <li> Programs can be reviwed and debugged easily. </li>
    </ol>
     
    <h2>Advantages of Algoriths</h2>
    <p>some advantages of algorithim are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b> Reduced Complexity </b>
            <p>Writing algorithm and program separately simplifies the overall task by dividing it into two simpler tasks. While writing the algorithm, we can focus on solving the problem instead of concentrating on a particular language.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Increased Flexibility </b>
            <p> Algorithm is written so that the code may be written in any language. Using the algorithm, the program could be written in Visual Basic, Java or C++ etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b> Ease of Understanding </b>
            <p>It is not necessary to understand a particular programming language to understand an algorithm. It is written in an English like manner.
         </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 style="color: #3f3ff6;">Number System </h2>
    <p>A set of values used to represent the quantites is known as Number System.</p>
    <h3 style="color: #4169E1; ">Radix or Base </h3>
    <p>
        Number of digits used in a number system is called its base or radix. Base is written after the number in subscript such as 
      <b>
        768<sub>10</sub>
      </b>
    </p>
    <p>Some important number systems are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Binary number system</li>
        <li> Octal number system</li>
        <li> Decimal number system</li>
        <li> Heaxadecimal number system</li>
    </ul>
